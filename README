- This script executes commands on multiple hosts through ssh.
- It is adviced that id_rsa.pub is appended to
  ~/.ssh/authorized_keys on target hosts. This can free you from
  entering password everytime.

Usage: ./ssh-execute [-h] [-f config_file] "[CMD]"
            -h: optional; has to be first arg;
                do not execute any command but display this message
            -f: optional; has to be first arg;
                use config_file as configuration file
         [CMD]: the command line that is to be executed.

* \N in [CMD] will be substituted with corresponding [number]
  indicated in configuration section

Files:
        ~/.ssh-execute: configuration file

Examples:
    ./ssh-execute -h
    ./ssh-execute -f ./example.ssh-execute ls --color -hl
    ./ssh-execute "echo \N"
    ./ssh-execute "ip addr add 10.0.0.\n/24 dev wlan0"
    ./ssh-execute -t pacman -Sy base-devel
          * -t here is an ssh option
